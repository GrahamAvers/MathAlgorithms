This is a matlab function that will estimate that integral of a line given data points. 
If it there is an odd number of data points, the trapezoidal rule will be used for the last point

Inputs:
- x : vector of equally spaced independed variable
- y : Vector of function values in relation to x

Outputs:
- I : The numerical integral calculated using the simpsons rule
